# COmpLementing nondeterministic büchi Automata
Complement algorithms implementation for UNBA (Unambiguous Nondeterministic Büchi Automata) and SDBA (Semi-Deterministic Büchi Automata).

### First version 2021.6.28
The [slice-based algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09125v2) for UNBA complementation is implemented as a function in [Seminator](https://github.com/mklokocka/seminator). 

### 2021.7.2
* Fixed bugs in NCB algorithm implementation. 
* NSBC algorithm is implemented.
* random_nd.ltl has passed.
